Meydan: A Vision of Dubai's Future

Meydan is the culmination of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision to create not just a venue for horse racing, but an integrated and sustainable city. 

From brand identity and environmental/wayfinding design to constructing a stadium in 60 days, Lumina Communications launched the architectural scale model in the desert of Dubai and brought it on a touring exhibition from Dubai to Shanghai.
