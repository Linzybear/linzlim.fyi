Meydan: A vision of Dubai's Future

Meydan is the culmination of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision to create not just a venue for horseracing, but an integrated city that is sustainable. From brand identity to constructing a stadium in fifty days, Lumina Communications launched the model in the desert of Dubai and brought this concept to the Cityscape exhibition series. I created the logo and oversaw art direction across all touchpoints throughout the touring exhibition from Dubai to Shanghai.
