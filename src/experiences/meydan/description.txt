Meydan: A vision of Dubai's Future

Meydan is the culmination of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision to create not just a venue for horseracing, but an integrated city that is sustainable. From brand identity to constructing a stadium in less than 60 days, Lumina Communications launched the architectural scale model in the desert of Dubai and brought this vision on a touring exhibition from Dubai to Shanghai.
