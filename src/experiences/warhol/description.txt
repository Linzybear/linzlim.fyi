"A is for Andy - 20 years after Warhol" was the first-ever exhibition of such impressive magnitude in Singapore to feature Andy Warhol's most unique and iconic works. Thrilled to be part of this one-of-a-kind event from coming up with the slogan to getting involved in the creative direction from invites to website to event set decor. It was extremely satisfying to turn an empty theatre space into a Warhol-inspired exhibition for a week of private media/sponsor nights as well as public viewings over a weekend.
