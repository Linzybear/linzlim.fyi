A Little Daily Dose: Discovering Chinese Characters Through Short Stories

A conventional book with an unconventional approach towards learning Mandarin Chinese. Through four bilingual short stories, color-coded Chinese characters are slowly introduced, in English, to the reader. The book's layout features Chinese stories on the left-hand pages, with corresponding English stories on the right, enabling seamless character recognition and contextual understanding.

Collaborated with a web developer to create an online vocabulary handbook to introduce Chinese characters to readers and accompany them during the transition between taking the first step and taking it further.
