Pre-launch party of Residences at St. Regis

During the early days of construction, Lumina-China was tasked to organize an exclusive VVIP party at the clubhouse. After a site visit to Lijiang (Yunnan), the stage was envisioned to incorporate the five elements that inspired the property development. Led the creative direction from conceptualization to completion with event planning and management; worked with local teams from Beijing and Chengdu to produce video production and work on dance choreography; supervised the fabrication and set up of the stage and eventually ran the night's show.
