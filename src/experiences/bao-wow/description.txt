BAO WOW - Buns We Love 

BEAMY collaborated with Mohawk Paper, which shares a similar vision, to develop an interesting corporate gift. Inspired by the traditional bamboo steamer, a circular box is designed with a contemporary touch to reveal the book title within. An array of 12 customized crystal magnets captures oneâ€™s attention as they sit circularly on the top tier. Matching infographics (in the notebook) provide a detailed introduction and pronunciation of each of the twelve buns. This also serves as a handbook for foreigners to learn and make notes as they explore the wonders of the Chinese language and its staple food culture.
