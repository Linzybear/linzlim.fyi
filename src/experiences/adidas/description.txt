Had the opportunity to turn an empty warehouse into a "house party" for the 60th Anniversary of Adidas. From the initial sketches to furniture sourcing; from overseeing the setting up of plywood panels to styling each corner with branded content, the space was totally transformed and packed to full capacity.
