https://www.parksconservancy.org/projects/stinson-beach-bolinas-lagoon-coastal-resilience-projects

Worked closely with Projects team and external park partners to roll out first-ever multiagency projects factsheet with an accessible Okabe-Ito color palette (for the map and project listings) as well as year-round activities and nature observations. Created and built web version to ensure information is easily accessible online.
