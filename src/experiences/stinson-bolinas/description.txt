Sea level rise is a symptom of global warming - rising water levels could reach 2 to 5 feet by the year 2100, with huge impacts to communities and ecosystems if no action is taken. Worked closely with the Projects team to roll out first-ever multiagency projects factsheet to communicate how park partners are responding to sea level rise. Created and built web version to ensure information is accessible online.
