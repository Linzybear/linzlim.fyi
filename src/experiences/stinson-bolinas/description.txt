Stinson Beach & Bolinas Lagoon Coastal Resilience Projects

Collaborated with the Park Projects & Conservation branch (Parks Conservancy) and park partners to roll out webpage, resources, and multiagency factsheet in communicating ongoing coastal resilience works around Stinson Beach and Bolinas Lagoon.

A little more: we added "what to see" and "how to get involved" as a holistic approach to illustrate how tide watching and wildlife observations are interconnected to the projects.
