Stinson Beach & Bolinas Lagoon Coastal Resilience Projects

Collaborated with the Park Projects & Conservation branch (Parks Conservancy) and park partners to roll out webpage, resources, and multiagency factsheet in communicating ongoing coastal resilience works around Stinson Beach and Bolinas Lagoon. 

Created a cohesive visual identity using a single-color logo panel and implemented an accessible Okabe-Ito color palette to ensure visual consistency and ADA compliance. Introduced "what to see" and "how to get involved" sections to facilitate public engagement in coastal conservation via community science programs such as perigean spring tide watch and wildlife observations.
