YSL Beauty: Le Cushion Encre De Peau

An iconic on-the-go product, Le Cushion Encre de Peau has been a beauty essential for women since its launch in 2016. For the first time in 2021, Le Cushion Encre de Peau (Limited Edition) is dressed in a real couture fabric. BEAMY created a series of 3 ambassador videos for social media engagements to drive online purchases during the pre-launch.
