YSL Beauty: Le Cushion Encre De Peau (Social media engagement for ambassadors)

An iconic on-the-go product, Le Cushion Encre de Peau has been a beauty essential for women since its launch in 2016. For the first time in 2021, Le Cushion Encre de Peau (Limited Edition) was dressed in a real couture fabric. 

BEAMY created a series of videos for ambassadors to drive online purchases (through Instagram post and stories) during the pre-launch.
