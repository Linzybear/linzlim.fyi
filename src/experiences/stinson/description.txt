Stinson Beach & Bolinas Lagoon Coastal Resilience Projects
https://www.parksconservancy.org/projects/stinson-beach-bolinas-lagoon-coastal-resilience-projects

Worked closely with Projects team (internal) and park partners (external) to roll out first-ever multiagency projects factsheet with an accessible color palette (Okabe-Ito). We met at Stinson Beach over January and February to observe the perigean spring tides (also known as king tides). More to come re: climate communications.
