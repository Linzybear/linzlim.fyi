One Tam partners have developed a strategy to improve and maintain the natural resilience of forests and woodlands in the face of stressors. &#8594 | &#8599

Together with passionate One Tam storytellers, a self-guided forest walk around Lake Lagunitas was created and produced to off­er a glimpse into forest restoration e­fforts. English and Spanish printouts were made available for the Tam Van's community outreach. 

Many successful forest-themed community engagement programs after, a second walk was produced for Rock Spring to provide a closer look at the role of fire on the landscape. The newest addition at Roy's Redwoods is a magical walk through redwoods, water and wonder.
