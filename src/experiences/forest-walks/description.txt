https://www.parksconservancy.org/parks/self-guided-forest-hikes-mt-tamalpais

One Tam partners have developed a strategy to improve and maintain the natural resilience of forests and woodlands in the face of stressors. Collaborated with passionate One Tam storytellers to pilot "What is a healthy forest?" - a self-guided forest walk around Lake Lagunitas -off­ering public a glimpse into e­fforts to restore forests. Upon its success in generating awareness through the Tam Van's forest-themed community engagement programs, a second walk "Why do forests need beneficial fire?" was produced for Rock Spring. Bilingual versions (English and Spanish) were made available online.
