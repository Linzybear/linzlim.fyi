One Tam: Self-guided Forest Walks
https://www.parksconservancy.org/parks/self-guided-forest-hikes-mt-tamalpais

One Tam partners have developed a strategy to improve and maintain the natural resilience of forests and woodlands in the face of stressors. 

Together with passionate One Tam storytellers, a self-guided forest walk around Lake Lagunitas was created to off­er public a glimpse into e­fforts to restore forests. English and Spanish printouts were made available for the Tam Van's community outreach.

Upon its success in generating awareness through forest-themed community engagement programs, a second walk was produced for Rock Spring, providing a closer look at the role of fire on the landscape.
