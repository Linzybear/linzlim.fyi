One Tam: Self-guided Forest Walks
https://www.parksconservancy.org/parks/self-guided-forest-hikes-mt-tamalpais

One Tam partners have developed a strategy to improve and maintain the natural resilience of forests and woodlands in the face of stressors. Together with passionate One Tam storytellers, a self-guided forest walk around Lake Lagunitas "What is a healthy forest?" off­ered public a glimpse into e­fforts to restore forests. Upon its success in generating awareness through the Tam Van's forest-themed community engagement programs, a second walk "Why do forests need beneficial fire?" was produced for Rock Spring, providing a closer look at the role of fire on the landscape. Bilingual versions (English and Spanish) were made available online.
