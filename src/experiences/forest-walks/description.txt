One Tam: Self-guided Forest Walks

Together with passionate One Tam storytellers, a self-guided forest walk around Lake Lagunitas was created in 2023 to off­er a glimpse into forest restoration e­fforts. English and Spanish printouts were produced for Tam Van's community outreach and pdfs were made available online. 

Many successful forest-themed community engagement programs after, a second walk was produced for Rock Spring the following year to provide a closer look at the role of fire on the landscape. This spring, the newest addition at Roy's Redwoods is a magical walk through redwoods, water and wonder.
