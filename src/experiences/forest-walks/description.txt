One Tam: Self-guided Forest Walks

Together with passionate One Tam storytellers, a self-guided forest walk around Lake Lagunitas was created and developed in 2023 to off­er a glimpse into forest restoration e­fforts... 

Tabloid-sized printouts were produced in English and Spanish for Tam Van's community outreach and pdfs were made available online. After a year of successful forest-themed community engagement programs, a second walk was produced for Rock Spring in 2024 to provide a closer look at the role of fire on the landscape. 

This spring, the newest addition at Roy's Redwoods Preserve is a magical walk through redwoods, water and wonder.
