A Little Beijing: Your Niche Travel Guide

Back in the day before smartphones were a thing, travelers had to lug their thick and heavy copies of Lonely Planet guidebooks everywhere.

A Little Beijing - in the form of sixty postcards and a map - introduces travelers to a new, light, way to explore a city. Based on a route less traveled, travelers are encouraged to mail their thoughts back to themselves on postcards. Upon their return home, they would find the perfect souvenir in the form of stamped mementos from their travels.
