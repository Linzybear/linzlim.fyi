In Mandarin Chinese, the colloquial phrase "Adequate 够 [gòu] Friend 朋友 [péng you]" is often expressed when a friend has gone beyond your expectations. For this project, I came up with a wordplay, substituting 朋 [péng] with Eddie's surname 彭 [péng], as the slogan of the campaign. A video was shot and produced in Shanghai to show the exceptional hospitality of Eddie Peng in generating brand awareness for Airbnb.
