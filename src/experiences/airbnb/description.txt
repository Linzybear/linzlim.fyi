Airbnb x Eddie Peng Ambassador Campaign

The colloquial phrase "够 (gòu) 朋友 (péng you)" in Mandarin Chinese is often used to express "Enough (of a) Friend" when a friend has gone beyond and more than enough. With a wordplay of similar sounding word, 朋 (péng) is substituted with Eddie's surname 彭 (péng), as the slogan of the campaign. 

A promotional video was shot and produced in Shanghai as part of the brand awareness campaign to launch Airbnb in China.
